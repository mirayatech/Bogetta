- How to create a hydrate component to ensure the client and server are in sync when rendering pages.
- Framer Motion: AnimatePresence, which is used to create smooth and engaging page transitions.
- How to create a payment intent via Stripe and add it to the Prisma schema.
- Fetching data with the API routes and how to handle incoming requests.

And much more!
